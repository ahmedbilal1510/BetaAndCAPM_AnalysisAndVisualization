# BetaAndCAPM_AnalysisAndVisualization
This project allows the user to scale and visualize the prices of stocks, calculate the Beta of an individual stock in a group of stocks, apply the CAPM formula to a single stock, and calculate the Beta for all the stocks in the group. 

Beta is a measure of the volatility—or systematic risk—of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole. Beta is used in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets (usually stocks). -(copy and pasted from Investopedia (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp#:~:text=Beta%20is%20a%20measure%20of,for%20assets%20(usually%20stocks))

- Beta represents the slope of the line regression line (market return vs. stock return). 
- Beta is a measure of the volatility or systematic risk of a security or portfolio compared to the entire market (S&P500) 
- Beta is used in the CAPM and describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets 

- Beta = 1.0, this indicates that its price activity is strongly correlated with the market. 
- Beta < 1, indicates that the security is theoretically less volatile than the market (Ex: Utility stocks). If the stock is included, this will make the portfolio less risky compared to the same portfolio without the stock.
- Beta > 1, indicates that the security's price is more volatile than the market. For instance, Tesla stock beta is 1.26 indicating that it's 26% more volatile than the market. 
- Tech stocks generally have higher betas than S&P500 but they also have excess returns
